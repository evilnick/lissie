This is a secret doc-generating framework for sources in Markdown.
Yes, it is a terrible kludge, but one day it might be nice.


In its current form, running make docs converts all Markdown sources in a directory in the src/ directory into HTML5 docs in a created directory called build. The included templates add headers and footers, and do some jiggery pokery to replace placeholders in the templates.

Aside from adding content, the immediate goals are to add a toc/index/navigation generation feature
